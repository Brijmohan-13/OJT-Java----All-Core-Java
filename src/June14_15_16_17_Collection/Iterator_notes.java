/*  Iterator is used for Object reading
	
	
	Iterator interface has following two methods
	
		boolean hasNext();
		Object Next();
			
			
			To use these two methods we need object of Iterator and reference which points to it
			
			
			iterator();  from collection-->list-->ArrayList gives object of iterator interface(its implementing class object)
			
			ArryList al=new ArraList();
			al.iterator();                this gives object of iterator
			
			Iterator it = al.iterator();		*/
