	//abstraction is nothing but hiding the implementaion 

	//Abstract class/Interface does not know how many childs it does have.
	//Also class/Interface it does not know how these methods are implemented in child classes
	//*****Reference is always considered as parent class because in real time we don't know child class name

	/*Example=
		Sun Microsystem has driver Interface which is implemented by dababase companies(oracle,mysql)
		*/

	
	//In case of dynamic dispatch..reference is given as parent class and child class's object is created
	
	//private-within class only
	//default-within package
	//public-within project
	//protected-within project but by using
	
	
//	visibility=accessibility
//	visibility modifier=access modifier
//	encapsulation deals with variable ,abstraction deals with methods
	
	
	//General we can not write same methods with same signature in same class at least argument should be different
